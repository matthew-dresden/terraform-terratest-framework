## CI/CD Pipeline and Release Process

The project uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for validation, testing, and releasing. For detailed information, see the [CI/CD Pipeline Documentation](CI_CD_PIPELINE.md).

### Pull Request Process

When you submit a pull request:
1. Automated checks will validate your code (linting, tests, coverage)
2. Code owners will be automatically notified for review
3. All checks must pass and reviews must be approved before merging

### Automated Release Process

Releases are managed automatically through GitHub Actions when changes are merged to the main branch:
1. Automated tests and validations are run
2. QA approval is required
3. Version is determined based on commit messages
4. Changelog is generated
5. Changes are committed and tagged

### Manual Release Process

For exceptional circumstances when the automated pipeline cannot be used:

```bash
# Create a manual release based on commit messages
make release-manual

# Explicitly specify the version bump type
make release-manual TYPE=major
make release-manual TYPE=minor
make release-manual TYPE=patch
```

This should only be used when the automated pipeline is unavailable.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Go best practices and idiomatic Go.
- Use `make format` to format your code before committing.
- Use `make lint` to check for linting issues.

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR: `make test`
- Check test coverage: `make test-coverage`

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any changes to functionality.
- Document new features, options, and behaviors.
- Keep the README and other documentation up to date.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need help, please:
